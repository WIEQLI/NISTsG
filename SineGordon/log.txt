due to the difficulty of calc scattering matrix near z=0 we deform away from z=0 using a diamond of radius 1. 
Not working since this lensing requires an analytic solution inside the diamond

try if this is spectrally accurate up to machine epsilon first. think about how to deal with the poles later


this code uses the transformed odes for scattering (zero gauge)


things to do (truncation?)
things to do (error up to machine epsilon compared with i.v)
things to do (error compared with non deformation)


transformation doesn't improve?
